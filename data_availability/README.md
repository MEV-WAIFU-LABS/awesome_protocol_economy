## data availability

<br>

### tl; dr

* data availability is the proof that the underlying data behind a particular hash was actually published 
* in the case of ethereum, da is one of the primary scaling bottlenecks. 
* protocol-level changes such as sharding and eip-4488 (proto-sharding) are intended to increase da and reduce the cost of storing data on ethereum (the current leading design is **danksharding**, which should happen in several steps).
